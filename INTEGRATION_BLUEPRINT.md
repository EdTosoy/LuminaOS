# Lumina OS: Google Product Integration Blueprint

## Moving Beyond the Browser: Native-Style Ecosystem

To truly compete with a "Pixel for Arch," Google products shouldn't just be tabs in a browser; they should be part of the OS fabric.

## 1. Google Workspace (Storage & Calendar)

**Goal**: Access your files and schedule without leaving the file manager or the shell.

| Product | Integration Method | The "Lumina OS" Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Drive** | `rclone` + `gvfs-google` | Mounted at `/mnt/gdrive`. Files show up natively in your file manager (Thunar/Dolphin) with cloud-sync icons. |
| **Calendar** | Waybar `custom/calendar` | A sleek calendar module in the bottom bar that pulls your live Google Calendar events via API and displays them in a Material-styled popup. |
| **Google Keep** | PWA + Custom CSS | A floating, translucent sidebar widget that allows for quick note-taking, synced with your Pixel. |

## 2. Google Gemini (The Intelligent Shell)

**Goal**: Transform the AI into an OS-level agent.

- **The "Contextual Portal"**: A `Super + G` shortcut that opens a Gemini overlay.
- **System Integration**: Using the Gemini API to pass the names of open windows or your current system state to the model.
  - *Example*: "Gemini, find the email I was just looking at in Chrome and summarize it here."
- **Terminal Integration**: `gemini-cli` wrapper that helps you debug Arch commands when you get an error.

## 3. Communication & Phone (Ecosystem Hub)

**Goal**: Make the desktop an extension of your Google Pixel.

- **Google Messages**: Integrated via the "Pixel Hub" using `scrcpy` (for the actual app) or a dedicated PWA.
- **Pixel Camera**: A utility that lets you toggle your Pixel's front/back camera as your primary Linux webcam with one click.
- **Google Photos**: A "Live Tile" widget in the dash that rotates through your recent Google Photos, synced via API.

---

## 4. Google Entertainment (YouTube & Music)

**Goal**: High-performance, distraction-free media control.

- **YT Music**: A dedicated Media Controller in the Waybar that uses the "Material You" accent colors of the album art currently playing.
- **YouTube Mini-Player**: A Hyprland window rule that keeps YouTube videos in a "Picture-in-Picture" mode by default, pinned to a specific corner of the workspace.

---

## 5. The "Material Customizer" (Technical Magic)

To make these integrations feel "Google," we will use **Custom CSS Injection**:

- **Nativefier / Electron**: For web apps (Drive, Calendar), we wrap them in a container that injects a CSS file generated by **Matugen**.
- **The Result**: When you change your wallpaper, the background color of your "Google Keep" window and your "YouTube Music" player changes instantly to match.

## 💡 Competitive Strategy Check

**Why is this better than Windows or standard Ubuntu?**
Windows has many "ads" and slow integrations. Standard Linux makes you set these up manually one by one. **Lumina OS** provides a unified "Google Login" script that sets up all of these mounts and styling at once.

**Does this technical approach (API + PWA + Mounts) sound like the right level of integration?**
